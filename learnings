I used SQL window functions like LAG to calculate year-over-year placement growth.
Power BI is used to transform raw data into meaningful visual insights.
I connected MySQL with Power BI and built dashboards showing placement trends, salary comparison, and growth analysis
For basic analysis, I used SQL for calculations and Power BI for visualization.
The goal of my analysis was to convert placement data into insights that help students and placement cells make better decisions
